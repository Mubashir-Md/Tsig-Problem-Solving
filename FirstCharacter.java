//Question : Prepbuddy has a string S consisting of lowercase Latin Letters. The String S can contain some repeated characters, no repeated characters, and maybe all repeated characters. He is trying to find the first character which is non-repeating in S . The String S contains many non-repeating characters, so he is not able to find the answer. You can help him to find the answer. Note:- Print âˆ’ 1 if there is no non-repeating character.
